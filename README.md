# Exponential-concentration-in-quantum-kernel-methods
This repository contains the data and code in the paper "Exponential concentration in quantum kernel methods".

It contains two main folders (i) plot and (ii) code.

Let us talk about the plot folder first. As the name suggested, if you are interested in raw data and simply plotting graphs again from them, this is where you want to go. Simply download everything, put them in the right order (which are the default, basically), (re-)run the python files within and enjoy ! 

"My code? If you want it, I'll grant it! Search on! All the world had to offer, I left in that folder!" -- If you are interested in the code itself, I'm sorry about the mess you are about to face. However, if you simply just run it, it produces some plots that are more or less what included in the paper from scratch. Some code relies on Pennylane and the version I used is 0.20.0 (I know, it's from an ancient time) but the newer versions should also work fine. Understanding the code itself, on the other hand, is a bit more challenging. If you suffer too much, please feel free to contact me and I will get back to you as soon as possible. 

Note that I ran the noise simulation on some cluster, but I have included the code here anyway. Those whom I typically call "advanced players" should have no problem following them. For those who are more like beginners, I have also included some example that you can just play around.
